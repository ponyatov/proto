### See <a href="http://ponyatov.quora.com/On-computer-language-design-prototype-knowledge-database-implementation">Quora blog</a> for more info

* object FORTH-like script language written in Python used as DDL/DML for
* knowledge representation object/graph database with
* active objects can process data being activated by in-database events or external requests

### Stage 0

@ref stage0

* has minimal @ref sym tree limited only for
* dumb source code file generation for next gen version /Python/
* `S0.py.src` file contains source code in oFORTH OML (object manipulation language) creates next-gen system implementation

### Stage 1 /TODO/

@ref stage1

* <b>metaprogramming system</b> implemented in Python using <b>autogen</b>erated code by @ref stage0
* <b>single node</b> implementation with
* <b>simple IDE/GUI</b> using wxPython and
* HTTP <b>web backend</b> engine
* includes <b>C89/C++ codegen backend</b> for embedded systems design
* and <b>managed compilation</b> toolkit via LLVM backend

### Stage 2 /looks never be gained/

* grab SmallTalk live object messaging model and
* Erlang/Elixir scalability and fault tolerance into
* <b>distributed software development platform</b>

### TODO

Integrate bests of
* <b>SmallTalk</b> live object messaging model
* <b>Elixir/Erlang</b> scalability and fault tolerance
* <b>Python</b> batteries and its friendly for newbies clue
* <b>FORTH</b> as a simplest CLI/DML/DDL language
* <b>Prolog</b> able to do inference over hypergraphs/Minsky frames
